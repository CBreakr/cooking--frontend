## Search and Share Recipes

## Technical Details

This site was made with a React javascript frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend. It uses a PostgreSQL database for storage, ActiveStorage & the React Dropzone component for drag-and-drop image upload.

## Next Steps

Right now there's no splash page for users when they first log in. We had thought to just display the user's current recipes, but this wouldn't be useful for users who just signed up. Something more instructive would be a better choice.
